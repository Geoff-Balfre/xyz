The Lean-Agile Coach was born in 2016 out of a desire to help spread the positive benefits of organisational agility.

We have been supporting change and transformation across industries such as telecommunications, banking, insurance services, global e-commerce, government for over 10 years.  We have implemented Agile practices and supported the growth and development of Scrum Masters, Product Owners, Business Analysts & Software Development teams. We have developed highly interactive and inspiring Agile courses and we provide advice that goes beyond the simple transmission of an Agile method because we know that there is no single version of Agile.

We are deeply convinced that Agility is the key to envisioning a profitable and sustainable future for organisations. Our thinking and core values are firmly based in the Agile Principles and the Agile Manifesto.

We want to provide individuals and companies with the best tools and solutions to help create a learning culture that ensures sustainable growth for the entire company.

We are passionate about human relationships: considering people as unique and singular is one of our preferred Agile values with the goal of doing things together. We believe that becoming Agile means that you can adapt more effectively in a VUCA world and be resilient in times of uncertainty.

As Agile Coaches, we need to wear different hats when it suits a particular situation. At times we are agile lean practitioners and others we are teachers, mentors, coaches and facilitators.

Ongoing learning is key for agile coaches and those involved in agile change and transformation and this is why we want to take the ICAgile courses to more agile roles. We wish to contribute to the ICAgile community by teaching about an agile mindset and growth mindset and encourage agile practitioners towards mastery in their chosen discipline.
